\begin_layout Standard
Denemo lets you create musical scores.
 You can type music in using the keyboard or play it in using a MIDI contoller
 or the microphone input.
 You can edit your music – the input display window shows you what you are
 working on in music notation – and you can playback to check how it sounds.
 The Print View window shows the final printed score, typeset to the highest
 standards used in the music publishing industry – thanks to the Lilypond
 music typesetting program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This separation of the final typesetting window from the input display avoids
 the constant dragging about of overlapping notation which is typical of
 music notation programs.
 It also means you are less likely to input a slur when you mean a tie,
 or a whole note rest when you mean a whole measure rest, for example –
 these often look similar in the typeset and are easily confused, but Denemo's
 input display makes clear the distinction.
 Nevertheless, if you do wish to tweak the appearance dragging and re-positionin
g of some notation is possible on the final typeset display.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Some Terminology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides the terms well-known to musicians, music notation has some specialized
 names and Denemo uses some terms with specific meanings which you should
 know:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A
\emph on
 movement
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Movement
\end_layout

\end_inset


\emph default
 is a continous stretch of music (all the measures following on from each
 other) such as a song in a songbook, or a movement in a symphony.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A 
\emph on
score
\begin_inset Index idx

\end_layout

\end_inset


\emph default
 is one or more movements usually interspersed with titles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A 
\emph on
staff
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Staff
\end_layout

\end_inset


\emph default
 has the usual meaning, but note that it may contain several lines of music
 (voices).
 A Denemo staff may also be typeset as a line of Chord Symbols

, or a line of dynamics markings above or below some other staff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The term 
\emph on
voice
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Voice
\end_layout

\end_inset


\emph default
 is used in two senses: as a line of music moving independently on a staff,
 
\noun on
and
\noun default
 (as in 
\emph on
Voice 1
\emph default
, 
\emph on
Voice 2
\emph default
), a voice that has its stems in one direction, with corresponding changes
 to the placing of ties, slurs, ornaments etc).
 Voices are normally displayed on separate staffs in the Denemo Display
 to make them easy to edit; the LilyPond typesetter has the task of placing
 them on the same staff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A 
\emph on
chord
\emph default

\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Chord
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is one or more notes of the same duration making a single musical object.
 If the notes are of different durations then they have to be placed in
 separate voices, they can't be a chord, though they may appear so (by sharing
 stems) in the typeset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A 
\emph on

 titles – that can have additional characters to indicate bold or italic,
 repositioning etc.
 In Denemo this may even include syntax for snippets of music, note-names
 fret diagrams etc., so that these can appear in the text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Staff Spaces
\emph default
 a unit of measurement: the distance between adjacent lines in a staff.
 Generally when you need to specify a distance in Denemo this is the unit
 used.
 So the Markup to System spacing is the spacing between the last title and
 the first staff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Part 
\emph default
is used with a special sense in Denemo: each staff has a part name associated
 with it (printed at top left of the staff, with a green background for
 editing it).
 All staffs with the same part name (or with none) are typeset together

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Input Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most people will start with playing around with Denemo using the mouse,
 but by the time you are reading this you will want something more efficient.
 Try using the pc keyboard.
 By default, keys 
\family typewriter
a
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
g
\family default
 represent the note names and 
\family typewriter
0
\family default
 to
\family typewriter
 6
\family default
 the different durations (whole note, half note etc).
 When the cursor is appending (blue) pressing key 
\family typewriter
0
\family default
 will insert a whole note at the cursor.
 Pressing the 
\family typewriter
a
\family default
 key will append the nearest A.
 If the duration of the next note is the same you can simply type the note
 name, it will use the last entered duration.
 There are keypresses (+/-, and plus/minus on the numeric keypad) to set
 sharp/flat/double-sharp/double-flat for the next entered note and to sharpen
 or flatten.
 Use +/- with the shift key to sharpen or flatten an existing note.
 Likewise, Shift with a number key edits the duration of a note.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the cursor is moved on to a note (with the arrow key or mouse) the
 cursor turns green and then 
\family typewriter
a
\family default
 to
\family typewriter
 g
\family default
 edits the note name.
 To insert a note before a note at the cursor use a double strike 
\family typewriter
A
\family default
,
\family typewriter
A
\family default
 to
\family typewriter
 G
\family default
,
\family typewriter
G
\family default
.
 When the cursor is green tothe keys
\family typewriter
 Shift
\family default
-
\family typewriter
0
\family default
 to
\family typewriter
 Shift-6
\family default
 change the duration of the note, while 
\family typewriter
0
\family default
 to
\family typewriter
 6
\family default
 insert a note before the cursor.
 (If you use the numeric keypad you can use 
\family typewriter
Shift-KP0
\family default
 to
\family typewriter
 Shift-KP6
\family default
 for this).
 The arrow keys move the cursor around, the period key adds a dot while
 
\family typewriter
Alt-a
\family default
 to
\family typewriter
 Alt-g
\family default
 add notes to the chord at the cursor.
 
\family typewriter
Ins
\family default
 inserts a note in a chord whether the cursor is on (green) or after (blue)
 a note, a double 
\family typewriter

When in the appending position the cursor shows as a large blue or red rectangle
 on a note-position.
 Blue indicates a note can be appended at that point without overflowing
 the measure.
 Red indicates that the measure is already full.
 When the cursor is a smaller green rectangle it indicates that you are
 not in the appending position: you can edit the note/object at the cursor
 or insert before it.
 The vertical blue line indicates the insertion point.

For a more detailed description of Denemo's various input methods, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:A-Survey-of-Input-Methods"

\end_inset

.
 You can find more shortcuts by exploring the menu system – e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
 under the Notes/Rests menu the Select Duration submenu gives Remove Dot
 with the shortcut Control-period shown in blue next to the command.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, a list is available in the Help menu.
 There are thousands of commands in Denemo, so get to know the Command Center
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:The-Command-Center"

\end_inset

 where you can search for commands by key words such as slur, ossia, beam,
 Da Capo, cresc.
 etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initially, Denemo starts with tooltips popping up almost everywhere.
 When they become too annoying you can tame them with Help->Turn Excessive
 Tooltips (Off/On), and you can further delay the remaining tooltips appearing
 via Edit->Change Preferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And once you have stopped playing around with the mouse for entering notes
 you can hide the palettes at the side to give more room for the music display
 (right click and Edit Palette).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Some Common Uses of MIDI in
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MIDI keyboard too can be customized to perform different actions.
 Usually, playing notes adds or edits the score (like hitting note names
 at the pc-keyboard).
 With the sustain pedal pressed chords are generated (the Alt key can be
 used for this too).
 If the interval between the notes played is augmented or diminished it
 is played on a different channel, so that you are alerted to possible pitch
 spelling errors (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
 inputting A-sharp for B-flat).
 By holding down the 
\family typewriter
Ctrl
\family default
 key a score can be checked by playing the notes – the cursor only advances
 if the correct note is played, and the 
\family typewriter
Shift
\family default
 key can be held down to route the MIDI keyboard straight to the output
 (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
 to check a phrase before playing it in).
 There is a button in the MIDI-in Controls to do this too, as well as a
 control to set the range of sharps and flats to be used.
 With the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Use Rhythm Entry for MIDI in
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 checked, the duration keys create pure durations (notes colored yellow/brown)
 – you can enter as much of the rhythm as you wish, and then play the notes
 on top.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Note and Rest Entry Palettes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On starting Denemo for the very first time a series of palettes are placed
 near the main window with buttons to insert and change notes.
 For more serious use these just waste space, so by right clicking on them
 and choosing Edit this Palette they can be hidden.

General Concepts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The unit of work in Denemo is a musical score, which can be saved in a single
 file (with .denemo suffix).
 This is represented on the screen by a "tab".
 If you have several tabs open at once they appear just above the music
 in the main window, and you can switch between them by clicking on the
 tab.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One score may contain several movements, which you can move between (
\family typewriter
PgUp
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
PgDown
\family default
), insert duplicate, merge and delete with the Movements menu.
 A movement is a 
\emph on

 piece of music with titles etc.

 The first thing on the status bar after any pending accidental

\end_inset

 is the movement number.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the top corner of the Display is a flag icon which sets values that apply
 to the whole movement.
 Here you can control which staffs are visible in the display, which are
 muted on playback, and edit any other properties of the movment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within a movement there are staffs (arranged vertically).
 Each Denemo Staff has in turn a Denemo Voice
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Voice
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and within the voice are the Denemo Objects.
 These can be notes, chords, key changes, time signature changes, voice
 change objects and Denemo Directive objects (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Denemo-Directives"

\end_inset

).
 The staff properties include things like the number of lines (usually 5)
 the MIDI instrument sound for playback and the amount of space allotted
 in the display for the staff.
 Before each staff are buttons to control properties of the staff – flags
 to set for visibility, mute, non-printing and the staff number which can
 be clicked to edit other staff properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notes and chords are displayed in conventional format (though not fully
 typeset).
 The position of Denemo Directive objects in the music is marked with a
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stick and blob
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and it is accompanied either by a drawing (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
 of a double barline) and/or some text to describe it.
 These are used for most things that are not chords or notes etc: Metronome
 marks, repeat barlines etc are good examples.
 In this example the caesura is a Denemo Directive object marked by the
 stick and blob before the last note and drawn on the staff in an approximate
 representation of its typeset appearance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Denemo Directives can also be attached to chords, individual notes in a
 chord, to a staff, to a movement or to the score; in these cases the directive
 can be thought of as an attribute of the object it is attached to.
 In the above example the trill sign is attached to the second note and
 this directive can be inspected and edited using the Object Inspector
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-Object-Inspector"

\end_inset

 and Object Editor 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Object-Editor"

\end_inset

.
 Denemo Directives attached to the staff, movement or score can be inspected/edi
ted too, using the relevant editors 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-Score-and"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-Staff-and"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there is more than one voice on a staff it is best displayed on a separate
 staff in the Denemo Display, for ease of editing – the clef is drawn pale
 and there is no time signature for such extra voices so it is easy to understan
d what is going on.
 The Print Preview window as usual shows the final typeset appearance.
 The clef in this case only affects the display, and any time signature
 or key signature set on it would also only affect the display.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Denemo display a cursor shows where the next note will be entered/edited.
 It is red for an over-full bar, blue for appending into an under-full one
 and green when editing (i.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

e.
 on an already entered object).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The menus in Denemo are unusual: they not only let you do some particular
 action, but also each menu item lets you add the command to a palette,
 enquire what the action does in more detail and set keyboard/mouse shortcuts
 for the action.
 A single keystroke can be set as a shortcut simply by pressing the key
 while the menu item is selected.
 All the extra functionality of menu items can be accessed by right-clicking
 the menu item, while the usual left click is for executing the action itself.
 The menus can always be torn off for working with particular items (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
 working with different movements or with measures, dynamics etc.).
 When you place a command in a palette you can add to an existing palette
 or create a new one – you can choose or create any number of these, free-floati
ng or docked in the main display.
 Also available by right-clicking is creating new actions – often by modifying
 ones that are already there – using the Scheme scripting window.

\begin_layout Standard
The main window has menus and toolbars at the top, and palettes at top and/or
 right hand side.
 Which menus and palettes are shown are selected via the View menu.
 At the bottom left is a status button showing which movement you are in
 and what sort of object the Denemo Cursor is on - clicking on this button
 lets you inspect/edit that object.
 Bottom right is a command button - it shows the last used command and any
 messages the commands may have given.
 Clicking on this button opens the Command Center
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 on the last used command, giving full information about what the command
 did.
 The function key Fn12 re-executes the command.
 When a MIDI filter is active it is displayed at bottom right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In between is where the music input is displayed, the Denemo Display area.
 When zoomed out you see just the few measures you are working on.
 By dragging the red bar at the bottom of the score upwards you get space
 for more of the music.
 If you have many staffs they may not all fit: you can still scroll the
 display to see several lines of just one or two staffs for instance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can hide staffs in the display if needed using the Staffs->Display Effects
 menu.
 If you need more room you can hide the menus (using the View Menu, shortcut
 Esc key), and arrange a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

page view
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the input music – useful when using playback.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the start of each staff are the staff tools: the flag icon lets you set
 whether the staff will be muted or non-printing and various other properties
 set on the staff; below that the staff number can be clicked to edit the
 Denemo Directives which you have installed on the staff.
 All these are available from the Staff/Voices menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Denemo Display
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Denemo Display
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The area showing the input music is called the Denemo display.
 It shows staffs and voices and the music interspersed with any Directives.
 The background is grayed out when the focus is elsewhere – click on the
 display to start typing in notes.
 The background is also colored when input from any attached MIDI keyboard
 is not being used for appending/editing the score (as it is by default).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default view has a single system stretching off the sides of the window
 – the actual division into lines and pages for the typeset score is done
 in the Print View
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-Print-View"

\end_inset

.
 In order to see more of the music on the screen at one time there are three
 changes to the default view you can make.
 Firstly by pressing the Esc key you can switch between three views, two
 of which have no menus taking up space.
 At the bottom of any of these is a red line which can be dragged up to
 split the display into separate lines.
 Using this you can display more bars of music at the expense of seeing
 more staffs for each system (the scrolling allows you to choose which staffs
 to concentrate on).
 As usual, this division into lines has nothing to do with the typeset view
 – widening the window will change the positions of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

line breaks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but have no effect on the final typeset score.
 Actual line breaks in the typeset are managed by the LilyPond typesetter
 and can be overruled by commands in the Directives menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second way of getting to see more of the music is simply to zoom the
 Denemo Display (Ctrl-mouse wheel is best).
 Again this is purely for the input display – you use commands in the Score
 and Directives menu to control the size of staffs, titles etc.
 in the final typeset score.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly with large (deep) scores – orchestral scores for instance – you may
 want to hide staffs in the display while you work on others.
 For example, you may want to hide all but the woodwind section.
 The commands for this are in the Staffs menu – you may want to change the
 keyboard shortcuts for navigating staffs (Ctrl-up arrow etc) to invoke
 the staff moves that skip over hidden staffs in this case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Page View
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:The-Page-View"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third of the three Denemo display modes that you get with the Esc key
 is called the Page View – it is set up initially with a small zoom factor
 and several systems showing.
 In this view the cursor highlighting has a large green circle around the
 cursor position and the display will animate during playback.
 As the music starts playing the second system down the page the top of
 the page is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

turned over
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 so that, as you reach the bottom of the page your eye can move up to the
 top of the page and follow the music on.
 Once the music starts again at the top of the new page the rest of the
 page is filled in replacing the old page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Transition Animation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the problems with moving about a score looking at the input music
 is that it can be difficult to see quickly where the cursor has moved to.
 An even more tricky situation arises when deleting empty measures – often
 the next measure is empty too, so it can appear that nothing has happened,
 it seems the command to delete a measure isn't working.
 What has happened is that another empty measure has moved in from the right
 and the display looks unchanged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To avoid these problems these transitions are animated – the measure coming
 in from the right can be visually seen to shunt in from the side; similarly
 staffs move up from below and the cursor arrives at its new position by
 shrinking onto it.
 All these animation effects (and the page animation of the previous section)
 can be turned off via View->Highlight Cursor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Main Menubar

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The New command starts a new score, while New Tab creates an empty score

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Open Submenu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Open command (Ctrl-o) opens a Denemo file for editing.
 Open Template opens one of the templates provided with Denemo – this is
 like open except the file once opened becomes untitled, forcing you to
 give it a name on saving.
 Open Example is similar, but here the scores are intended as examples of
 how to do particular things – they can also serve as a place to copy and
 paste from.
 Open Custom Template opens the directory where templates you have created
 with Save Template are stored.
 If you create a template called Default.denemo then the command Open Default
 Template will load it (Ctrl-n).
 Add Staffs and Add Movements take staffs or movements from the Denemo file
 chosen and add them to the current score.
 Open inNew does a combination of New Tab and Open.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open Source Audio loads an audio file creating empty measures with the audio
 displayed as a series of note-onsets in a line at the top of the display.
 The note-onsets can be dragged to achieve synchronization and tempo-matching
 between the notated bars and the audio.
 You can then add the notes (by ear) and play the two in sync to listen
 for discrepancies.
 This is best explained by the video demos (see

As with all controls and menu items you should hover over the buttons with
 the mouse to get an explanation of what they do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The playback starts at the playback start marker (a line in green down the
 score in the Denemo Display) and stops at the playback end marker (a red
 line).
 These lines are not displayed all the time, just once the play has been
 used at least once.
 The start/end markers can be altered with the arrow keys on either side
 of the Play and Record buttons.
 The arrows to the left adjust the playback start, those to the right the
 playback end (hover over the arrows for details).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
Playing of sections of the music and looping is possible (including editing

 as well as recording the audio output (mixed with anything you play on
 your MIDI keyboard if you have recording set in the MIDI controls).
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recording the audio output is also possible as well as real-time slow down
 of the audio playing back (not to be confused with simply setting a slower
 tempo!).
 This last is used when transcribing from audio (See File->Open->Open Source

\begin_layout Standard
There are two sorts of titles.
 Book titles have a separate title page with titles for individual movements
 which can be listed in an automatically generated table of contents.
 Simple titles give a Title and (optionally) movement titles on the same
 page.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comments (

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Table of Contents can be automatically generated from the movement titles
 by setting Book Titles->Table of Contents Title.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graphic title pages can also be created.
 These can be created by invoking the Inkscape vector graphics editor from
 within Denemo, or using it externally to create the title page.
 A sample title page is included both as an encapsulated postcript (EPS)
 file and as a scalable vector graphics (SVG) file.
 The latter is the form to use for editing the page to suit your needs,
 but it should also be saved as an EPS file as this is the format used to
 include it in the typeset score.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Typesetter Submenu

 rules can be set both in general (invoke Set Beaming Rules without a selection)
 or with exceptions (by invoking with a selection that has been beamed manually

 Use this latter to break up very short notes, for example, that would otherwise
 be beamed together while leaving the longer durations as normal.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Various score checking routines work at movement level from this menu and
 a command to re-bar the movment (or a staff or part of a staff) is also
 here as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 correspond with the actual typeset measures (which always follow the durations/
time signatures) or to re-bar a staff or passage or movement if you have
 changed your mind or got out of step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again there are titles menus for either simple or book titles, and for inserting
 graphics between movements.
 These can be used as decorative separators between movements or to insert
 columns of verses at the end of songs (each song is a separate

 When set time signatures can differ between staffs, and barlines do not

 Denemo's display copes with showing polymetric staffs on the whole, though
 you may need to use Measures->Hidden Measure to even up staffs in the display
 and mark measures with Measures->Ignore Measure Duration Error to prevent
 them being colored in the display.

 menu, for groups of notes that have a duration that is a fraction of the
 written duration, such as triplets.
 These actually insert tuplet start and end objects, before and after the
 notes concerned so, strictly speaking they should come in a separate miscellane
ous objects category.
 As usual, the most useful commands have shortcuts already – Tab starts/stops
 a triplet alternately (so you can press it once, enter the notes and press
 it again to finish the triplet).
 And the two key shortcut Keypad 7, Keypad 7 turns the note entered into
 a triplet of notes (with Control as well they are slurred).
 This is set as a two-key shortcut so that you can type it in as a triplet
 rhythm: e.

 the three keypresses 4, KP_7, KP_7 will give a triplet of three 1/16th

 Normally the lyric cursor should be at the stanza/verse start.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph*
Syllable Alignment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inserts special syntax to cause the text to be aligned with its start or
 end below the note (rather than the default centered position).
 This may be useful for chanted text.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Palettes are collections of commands arranged as a column, row or grid of
 buttons either in a separate window or docked in the Main Window.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The buttons are not just for mouse users – palette buttons can be executed
 by typing 
\family typewriter
p
\family default
 followed by (part of) the label of the button followed by the 
\family typewriter
Enter 
\emph on
or
\emph default

 key.
 The entry for keying in a palette label looks like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the top is the name of the palette that is active, in this case the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 palette.
 You can switch to a different palette with TAB – the palette does not have
 to be displayed on the screen, but if you type a label that does not exist
 it will be shown to remind you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make full use of the keyboard for executing commands from your palettes
 you should edit the labels so that they are easy to type & memorable.
 Put the shorter ones first as you do not need to type all of the label,
 just enough to select the needed button.
 Right-clicking on a palette button allows you to edit the button, changing
 the label or tooltip, duplicating the button (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
 to create an edited version of its script) and more, as in the following
 popup:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/PaletteMenu.png
	scale 60

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also edit the palette itself by right clicking on any button and
 choosing the Edit this Palette submenu (shown open above).
 You can make the palette fill up horizontally or vertically and restrict
 the number of columns/rows respectively.
 You can dock/undock palettes as well and hide palettes that are not needed
 (you can also hide undocked palettes by dismissing their window).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the View menu you can select a palettes of commands to display or show
 all the palettes and then hide the ones you don't want.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should make palettes your best friend – when you find a command in the
 menu system that you need right click on it and choose Add to Palette.
 This way you will build up one or more collections of commands that you
 need.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Palette buttons can also be created directly from objects or Denemo Directives
 so that you can duplicate them in your score without having to copy and
 paste.
 So, for example if you run Help->Open Feature Packed Score and find the
 type of object or attribute you need there then you can run the Object
 Inspector or one of the editors on it and create a palette button for installin
g the same thing in your own score.

 In the second use, by selecting a snippet as you enter pitches the durations
 are assigned from the next step in the snippet.
 The first case is especially useful when entering a complex rhythm which
 is repeated many times in the piece.
 In all cases the snippet can contain all sorts of attributes and markings,
 slurs, beaming indications, ornaments etc, and these will then all be entered
 with a single keypress or as you add pitches.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have finished entering music into Denemo you may find that you
 have a wrong note or two or a missed marking or slur when looking over
 the finished score in the Print View.
 It is convenient to shift-click (or click twice) on the notehead, marking
 etc.
 to position the Denemo Cursor on the object.
 For this to work look for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 pointer as you move the mouse over the typeset score.
 The hand pointer indicates a place where if you click the Denemo Cursor
 will move to the Denemo Object that belongs to that feature.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have located the note you wish to edit you can press the keyboard
 shortcut (or play the MIDI key or any other editing method) to change the
 note – to add a staccato marking for example.
 The Print View will not instantly update, but you can continue editing
 while it does so.
 If the Print View is not up-to-date the shift-click may not locate the
 correct note as your edit may have displaced things; to minimize this it
 is best to correct faults on a page from the bottom upwards.
 You are given a warning noise when the print view is not up to date, and
 a big warning noise if the locating has completely failed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The navigation using shift-click in the Print View works for noteheads,

 and various marks – some other things such as lyrics can't be used to navigate
 – choose the note that the lyrics underlie to find the right place in the
 Denemo Display.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can actually edit your input music using the mouse on the Print View
 window – something referred to as what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG),
 which is how the conventional music editors work all the time.
 But in doing this it will help if you keep in mind that the Denemo program
 does not know anything about what LilyPond has actually drawn in the Print
 View window – Denemo is just displaying the PDF file that LilyPond has
 created.
 The PDF file 
\emph on
does
\emph default
 contain links – the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 pointer – so it does 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

know
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 about where things are in the Denemo Display, but not the other way round.
 This means that to use wysiwyg features you have to tell Denemo more about
 what you are doing than you would expect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Editing Positions and Padding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right clicking on some objects in this pane allows you to edit them.Use this
 for the occasions when LilyPond has positioned things badly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The editing procedures depend on whether the object is attached to a note
 or appears between the notes in the Denemo Display.
 Depending on the object you can drag it to a better position or change
 whether it appears above or below the note its attached to.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also select an amount of padding to apply to some objects so that
 they keep their distance from other items in the score.
 Adjusting the padding is generally a better way of indicating that something
 is too close to something else, since other objects will move away from
 it as needed and if you later edit the score it will behave more intelligently.

 When you right-click on a slur or tie the Denemo Cursor moves to the note
 where the slur starts and you are offered the chance to edit the shape
 of the curve.
 Choose a large zoom factor before you begin, and turn on the control points
 (red dots and crosses) as described 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

above.
 Then right click on the curve and choose Edit Shape.
 You have to click on the reference point first – this is on the center-line
 of the staff at the horizontal position of the notehead where the curve
 starts – this is marked with a red dot.
 Then you click and drag on the four 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 that define the shape of the curve.
 Once the shape looks good, right click in a blank area and click Apply.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Adding Line or Page Breaks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Page or line breaks added by right-clicking on a note at a barline and choosing
 from the menu.
 This works because right-click positions the Denemo Cursor at the note
 and then the page or line break command is run just as if you were working
 directly in the Denemo Display.

There is also a pane that shows any error messages that LilyPond may issue
 when typesetting your score.
 When an error occurs the remainder of the text is marked in red.
 Using the arrow keys to move around this text, the Denemo cursor in the

 As a bonus, a single part can be typeset in this view with the whole accompanim
ent included in the playback – you can play from the part while hearing
 the other instruments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To start play from a note just click on the notehead, click again to stop
 playback.
 To play a short passage click on a notehead and drag to where you want
 the playback to end.
 To loop-play hold the shift key down as you drag from the start to the
 end of the passage to be looped over.
 To position the Denemo cursor at a note or rest shift-click a the notehead.

The All Parts button typesets the current movement for playback, generating
 the MIDI at the same time.
 The Current Part button does the same but just for the part that holds

MIDI Playback.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Playback View the MIDI is generated by LilyPond and has many more
 features than the simple MIDI generated by Denemo.
 This playback can still be controlled by the same commands in the Playback
 menu or the Playback Controls Panel and left-clicking on a notehead in
 the Print View, but in addition you can start play from any point in the
 music just by left-clicking on a note in the Playback View.
 Furthermore, in the Playback View, to play a section of the music click
 and drag to the end note desired.
 For a looping play hold the shift key while dragging.
\end_layout

If you alter the music then you need to re-typeset this view before you
 can play with Playback View.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Scrolling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can either check the Set Scrolling check box to automatically scroll
 as you listen, or you can set scroll points to determine exactly where
 the page will be when the point clicked is playing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Simple Scrolling Control
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For simple scrolling click the Simple Scrolling check box.
 The music will start to scroll after a while and continue at a steady rate.
 If it has scrolled too far you can scroll it back a bit while playing,
 it will carry on at the rate from where you leave it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Scroll Points
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For more sophisticated control you can set 
\emph on
scroll points 
\emph default
on the movement.
 This is what 
\emph on
right 
\emph default
clicking does in the Playback view – when you 
\emph on
right 
\emph default
click on a note head or rest Denemo will ensure that the page has scrolled
 while playing so that notehead has arrived at where it was when you clicked.
 With the music in the right place on the page for it to start, 
\emph on
right 
\emph default
click on the first note of the second system (so that the scrolling does
 not start until after you have heard the first system play) and then scroll
 the page up (using the mouse scroll wheel or the scroll bars) and click
 on the first note of the last system once the page is in the position desired
 for end-of-play.
 You hear a sound effect when the scroll point has been added to the list
 of scroll points for this movement and the place is marked with a green
 blob.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there are tempo changes, scroll the page to the desired position prior
 to the tempo change and click on the last note/rest before the tempo change.
 (Instead of clicking you can drag notes to the position you wish them to
 be in instead – it's the same thing).
 If you add a scroll point wrongly, just click it again to remove it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may also need to set intermediate scroll points if the music has passages
 with a flurry of notes – just position the music for such passages and
 
\emph on
right 
\emph default
click as with tempo changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that if you set scroll points on a movement these are remembered when
 you switch movements, and scroll points 
\emph on
are 
\emph default
saved with your score.
 This means that once you have set up your score for practicing playing
 your part, Denemo will remember how you like it to scroll.
 Note also that you can do minor edits without unduly perturbing the scrolling
 that you set.
\end_layout

Use the Clear Scroll Points button to delete all the scroll points that
 you have set if you wish to start over or right click on an individual

Making the Directive Conditional

\begin_layout Standard
The conditional button allows you to designate certain score layouts (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

g.
 typesetting just one part, or one movement) as ones for which this directive
 is active or ones which ignore the directive.
 So if the full score is wanted without fingerings then by clicking this
 button with the full score as the currently typeset layout the fingering
 directive can be designated as ignored by that layout.
 Further examples can be searched and similarly marked in the dialog that
 follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Making a Copy of the Directive
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This button copies the directive to the clipboard – it can then be pasted
 by moving the cursor elsewhere and invoking the paste command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Creating Palette Buttons for Objects and Properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Object Editor also has buttons for creating Palette Buttons for the
 Denemo Directive that it edits.
 There are two of these: one button would run the command that created the
 attribute/object the other will instantiate a duplicate – a clone – of
 the attribute/object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Create Button for Command
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This creates a palette button to run the command that created the Denemo
 Directive you have Object Editor open on.
 You are asked which palette you want to place the button in, and can create
 a new, custom, palette at that stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if you use this on the Arranger attribute of a score you will
 get a button that runs the command Arranger (which is found in Score->Titles\SpecialChar ldots
).
 That button would then ask you to fill in the name of the arranger.
 Compare this with the next button, where you will create a button that
 will install a clone of Arranger attribute that you have on this score
 – the arranger will be already filled in, saving you having to enter your
 own name each time you create a new score.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Create Button for Clone
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This creates a button which when clicked will insert a duplicate of the
 Denemo Directive that the Object Editor is looking at.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This means that for any specific attribute you want to re-use you can create
 a button that will install exactly that Denemo Directive at the cursor.
 So, even if you do not know how a particular effect was generated, you
 can create a palette button to use the effect in your own score.
 The Open->Open Example scores provide useful examples of things you may
 need.
 See the section on Palettes
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Palettes"

\end_inset

 for more about palettes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This button is particularly useful for things like your copyright notice
 which stays the same from score to score – you just need a clone to install
 on a new score.

\begin_layout Standard
Score Layouts are ways of typesetting a score for different purposes.
 Even without ever looking at the score layouts window you may find that
 you have been using them all along.
 For example, if you print just one part from a chamber work, or the vocal
 part from a song with piano accompaniment a score layout is created for
 this.
 In fact, layouts are always created when you typeset music – for example
 from the Print Window Typeset, Part or Movement buttons, or from the Print
 menu.
 These are 
\emph on
default score layouts 
\emph default
they are created automatically, and you don't have to think about them.
 
\end_layout

You can also create a layout using the Print->Select Staffs to Print menu
 item - by un-checking the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do not Create Layout for this selection
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 check box you can create a custom layout that will print just the staffs(voices
) that you leave checked.
 In addition other commands in the Print menu generate custom score layouts
 – for example a layout for the accompanist to play from, with the solo
 part printed on a smaller staff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For more extensive facilities in choosing how to lay out the elements of
 your score when typeset you can open the Score Layouts window.

 Note that the value 99 for dynamic compression is a

\begin_layout Standard
The View->Titles, Buttons etc checkbox makes two horizontal button bars
 visible (if they have buttons on them).
 What the buttons show are titles/composer etc for the score and for the
 current movement.
 The score button bar holds the movement indicator buttons for scores that
 have several movements – you can click on one of these to move quickly
 to a different movement.
 In addition other score-wide settings create buttons on the score titles
 bar and movement wide settings on the movement titles bar.
 The menu items that populate these are under Score->Titles etc., and Movement->T

Commands to control beaming are available for individual notes, whole passages
 of notes and entire scores.
 Mostly the default beaming will be what you want.
 An exception is the beaming in 3/4 time which can look like 6/8 when beamed
 in the traditional manner.
 Use Object Menu->Time Signature->Beam at Half Measure to alter the default.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Individual beam control commands are located in Notes/Rests->Beaming.
 The start/stop beam shortcuts are usually [ and ].
 Other commands include providing partial breaks in the beaming and stopping
 beaming on a note.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Setting beaming for the whole score can be done using ObjectMenu->Score->Typeset
ter->Set Beaming Rules.
 Either the general rule can be given, or Beam Exceptions can be set from
 the selection.
 To use the latter, set up a measure or measures with the beaming manually
 set using the Individual beam controls and then select the passage and
 invoke Set Beaming Rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Setting beaming for a passage can be done with ObjectMenu->Time Signatures->Set
 Beaming Rule.
 In addition, at a time signature change a beaming rule can be set using
 ObjectMenu->Time Signatures->Time Signature with Beaming Rule.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After automatic beaming has been turned off use ObjectMenu->Directives->Typesett
er->Start Beaming to insert a directive re-starting automatic beaming at

 The Cadenza On/Off commands turn on/off automatic beaming (as well as the
 timing control).

Barlines
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Barline
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The important thing to know about barlines in Denemo is that they are not
 just graphical marks on paper – e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
 you cannot put a repeat end barline followed by a repeat start barline
 and expect both to print – instead you must use a repeat-end-start barline.
 This is because you are telling Denemo about the music, not about how to
 draw it – the repeat-end-start barline is drawn completely differently
 if it occurs at the end of a line, for instance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another useful thing to understand is that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

barlines
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that appear in the Denemo display are not really barlines at all, just
 a convenient breaking up of the music into 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

chunks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Normally, of course, you will use one chunk per measure
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Measure
\end_layout

\end_inset

 so they 
\emph on
will
\emph default
 correspond with the typeset barlines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a relationship between line/page breaks and barlines: you cannot
 have line/page breaks at any point in the music, there must be a barline
 there.
 However this can be a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hidden
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 barline, so that option is in the menu too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One curious consequence of this is what happens if you contrive to input
 notes that are timed so that a note is always playing at every barline;
 normally you use tied notes for this, but if (by mistake) you leave one
 bar short in duration you can find that none of the following typeset bars
 start with a note, and the result is that the line cannot be broken – it
 extends off the right hand side of the page.

 and phrasing slurs.
 It is important to distinguish ties from slurs since they often look the
 same in the typeset music, but in some circumstances they are typeset different
ly – so you may think the music looks ok, and later after some editing,
 it looks wrong – you have hit a situation where the typesetting distinguishes
 the two.
 To help with this Denemo shows distinguishes slurs with little green and
 red markers for the start/end, while the ties are heavier horizontal curves.
 If you import music from other notation programs they often confuse slurs
 and ties, so a command to fix these is in the Notes/Rests->Tied Notes menu.
 (In the unusual case of slurred notes of the same pitch – e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
 open string/stopped note on a violin – you would have to correct the error
 by hand).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also in this menu are commands to tie individual notes in chords, to control
 the direction (up/down) of ties and to adjust the shape of ties which can
 be very tricky to position nicely in tight situations.
 Ties at repeats, where the tie goes to/comes from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nothing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, are here too;they are called Laissez Vibrer and Repeat Tie.
 (Laissez Vibrer has two uses, of course, but it is the same symbol).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The commands for slurs are in the Notes/Rests->Slurs menu.
 The most useful have the shortcuts 7,8,9 to slur from the current note
 to the next note, to extend the slur and to reduce it.
 There are also commands to turn on/off a slur start or slur end, and these
 are also in the right-click menu on the notes in the Denemo Display.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When entering rhythms with the numeric keypad the slurs can be added without
 breaking rhythm by using the control key with the rhythm.
 So, for example, Ctrl-3 enters a 1/8 duration slurring from the previous
 note, or extending the slur.
 And Control keypad 9 (Ctrl-KP_9) creates a slurred dotted rhythm (corresponding
 to keypad 9 which creates a dotted rhythm based on the last entered duration)
 and similarly Ctrl-KP_7,Ctrl-KP_7 for entering a slurred triplet based
 on the current duration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Phrasing slurs are slurs over the top of ordinary slurs, used in Romantic
 music and later.
 The display just shows where they start and end, the typesetter allows
 only one level of nesting slurs as that is all that is used in music.
 More would require a non-printing voice carrying the extra layers of slurs.

 these are handled in Denemo by two markers, one beginning the tuplet which
 holds the timing change and the other a simple end tuplet marker.
 The Denemo Display only knows how to display tuplets that start and end
 in the same bar, but the typesetter is not restricted in that way.
 You can stop and re-start the tuplets at measure breaks so that the Denemo
 Display understands what you mean, and control the placement of tuplet
 numbering and tuplet brackets using the Tuplet Brackets and Tuplet Numbering
 commands in the same menu.
 The typeset can also cope with nested tuplets perfectly well, though the
 Denemo Display will be strange.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are specific commands for the more common tuplets, and arbitrary tuplets
 can be started using the Arbitrary Tuplet command – you give the numbers
 to denote the fraction that the timing is changing by (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
 triplets are 2/3 of the duration written so you give 2,3).
 If you wanted 7 notes in the time of 4 you would give 4, 7 so that the
 durations changed by 4/7, after seven 1/8-notes you would have the equivalent

Grace Notes present a peculiar problem to the LilyPond typesetter that Denemo
 uses.
 As they do not have any duration it gets into difficulties if there are
 other things (such as time signatures, double bars etc) going on at the
 same time.
 The problem arises when other parts are also sounding and they don't have
 the same grace notes.
 There is a command in Denemo to work around this by installing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

grace note hints
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 – these are dummy non-printing grace notes in the other parts.
 This is done automatically by the Check Score routine, so normally you
 don't have to run it yourself, but it is in the Notes/Rests->Grace Notes
 menu.
 It is good to be aware of this however, as you will see these pale yellow
 rests that declare themselves to be grace notes in the input music display
 sometimes.

In some circumstances it is desirable to place dynamics in a separate

\emph default
This is often the case for the dynamics centered between piano staffs; it
 ensure that hairpins align with each other and that other dynamic markings
 are placed consistently.
 It also allows for positioning of dynamics markings other than directly
 on notes – they can be placed at slightly later or earlier times.
 To do this notes of shorter duration are put in the dynamics staff and
 the dynamic markings are attached to them.
 The notes are just dummy notes to indicate the timing of the onset of the
 dynamic attached.

Sometimes, all parts have the same dynamics.

\begin_layout Standard
With Denemo you can tailor Denemo to allow you to use your preferred method
 of entering notes via keyboard.
 You can set the keyboard shortcut for a command just by pressing the desired
 key while the menu item is selected.
 You can right click on the menu item and choose Open Command Center to
 set a two-key keyboard shortcut.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, Denemo offers several ways of entering music: typing at the
 keyboard, playing in via a MIDI keyboard (controller), playing in acoustically
 using a microphone or choosing items from the menu system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typing at the keyboard can be very fast, if you forget which keypress you
 need you can consult the menu system to find out.
 This method is good for touch typists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For entering a lot of already written-out music, playing the music in via
 a MIDI keyboard or microphone can offer the fastest and most musical method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With all methods of note entry a measure start sound will be heard when
 your note entry has moved to a new measure, which means you do not have
 to look up to know that you have started a new measure as expected.
 This measure start sound can be set to 0 in the preferences if unwanted.

 entering A-flat when G-sharp was meant, you will get a lot more augmented

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The best way to use the MIDI keyboard is enter the music firstly as pure
 rhythms using the pc-keyboard, ignoring the note names.
 The durations show as yellow/brown notes.
 Each duration makes a distinctive sound as you enter the durations.
 As you start each measure a sound is made so that you can keep your eyes
 on the score you are copying from, without needing to look up and check
 that you haven't miss-typed.
 If you are a reading musician you will find that you tap in the rhythm
 rhythmically which helps to keep your place in the piece you are entering.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have entered the rhythms for one or more measures you can play
 the notes via MIDI – the cursor automatically goes to the start of the
 rhythms you have entered.
 As you play notes in via MIDI they give their pitches to the rhythm you
 have notated.
 By this means you can enter a piece of music in the time taken to play
 it twice – once to give the rhythm and once to give the pitches.
 If the piece modulates strongly you may need to shift the set of accidentals
 used to match the score, the pitch spelling facility will alert you to
 this.
 (If entering pitches via a mic you need to navigate to the start point,
 but this isn't needed for MIDI in).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under Input->MIDI are various "MIDI filters

The problem of entering the wrong enharmonic is largely avoided by Denemo's
 simple pitch-spelling strategy.
 The more extreme intervals are played in a separate MIDI channel so that
 if, for example you enter F - A-sharp it sounds quite distinct from F -
 B-flat.

 which is indicated on the status bar.
 The duration keys, triplet key and dottify key can all be used with the
 Control modifier to slur from the previous note.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With this arrangement you can play in the rhythm of a piece in musical time
 and then play once more with the MIDI keyboard to add the notes (chords
 require the Alt key or foot pedal).
 Before you are practiced in this use of the numeric keypad it is a good
 idea to do just a bar or two, or a line or two at a time, so as not to
 lose your place.

\family typewriter
 a

 This provides one way of entering notes – move the cursor up or down to
 the note position and press a number key for the duration.
 If the note is to be out-of-key then the 
\family typewriter
equal 
\family default
or 
\family typewriter

key can be used to sharpen/double-sharpen/flatten/double-flatten the next
 note.
 This method of note entry is probably not the most efficient however: in
 the Input->PC Keyboard menu you can choose to make the number keys change
 the prevailing duration without entering a note.
 With that setting you can use the note names to append notes to the bar
 only pressing the number keys if the duration changes.
 The duration can be dotted/double dotted with the period key, and the octave
 adjusted with comma (for down) or apostrophe (for up).
\end_layout

Playing Notes into Denemo – Audio (Soundcard Mic Input)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Denemo can listen for, and detect the pitch of notes on the mic input of
 the computer; it doesn't attempt to guess the rhythm – such systems do
 not work well – but you will find that playing the notes in time will help
 you to play them in, as well as make playing them in a musical experience
 rather than a chore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Playing the notes in can be much quicker than using the keyboard since the
 note octave and accidental are all given just by playing the note.
 If you are able to play a musical instrument then this will probably be
 much faster for you than typing note names, octave shifts and accidentals
 at the computer keyboard.
 Using the headphones-out of an electronic keyboard avoids "noises-off"
 interfering with the pitch detection.
 Many microphones and pickups benefit from some pre-amplification – it is
 worth getting the level right before you begin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you select the Input->Audio on the Main Menu the Pitch Recognition
 window pops up.
 While the mouse pointer is inside the score drawing area the score is sensitive
 to pitches heard via the microphone input.
 The background colour of the score changes to show that the notes will
 be entered into the score.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two ways of using the pitch entry – Overlay mode (default) and
 Insert mode.
 The button marked Insert causes notes to be entered into the current measure
 in the prevailing rhythm – the mode is set to Insert for this.
 The button marked Overlays overlays the notes already present with the
 pitches you sound.
 There is a third button, marked Tuning, which is a state-of-the art musical
 instrument tuner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Music is entered into the measure which holds the cursor.
 If you are overlaying a rhythm already entered, then the first un-overlayed
 note in the measure is overlayed by the note detected.
 You can delete the overlay using the regular delete keys, or clear them
 altogether if you want to start over in a measure.
 If you are in Insert mode then the notes detected will be inserted at the
 cursor position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use the enharmonic shift to select whether Bb or A# should be entered when
 you enter the given pitch – you can usefully go as far as B# and Fb.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use the transpose control to shift up or down by octaves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the other settings would require study of the Aubio documentation
 to understand, but the one marked threshold may be useful to make the detection
 less sensitive to ambient noises if using a microphone with an acoustic
 instrument.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The best set-up is to plug the headphones-out socket of an electronic keyboard
 into the mic input, and choose a piano setting on the electronic keyboard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you don't have any musical instrument that you can plug directly into
 the mic in, then you can use an acoustic instrument with a microphone,
 in which case move your microphone closer or further from your instrument
 to get reliable detection.
 Too close and you get double detections, too far and you get missed ones.
 To check for good detection open a piece of music, set Overlay mode and
 put the cursor in the first measure and play the piece in – the notes should
 all turn blue if you have perfect detection.
 It is worth while getting perfect detection – more than one or two miss-detects
 per piece of music and you may want to use the Insert rather than the Overlay
 method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Audio Input button introduces a special entry mode where the pitches
 you play in will overlay the rhythm, appearing as blue notes.
 You can delete any wrong pitches using the usual delete keys, without deleting
 the rhythm.
 In fact if you have an "interloper" (an extra spurious note) you can delete
 it and the other pitches will all move along to their correct places.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another method of playing music in acoustically doesn't involve entering
 the rhythm separately.
 For this select Input->Audio and then choose Insert instead of Overlays
 on the Pitch Recognition Panel that pops up.
 With Insert the sounded notes are entered as in the prevailing rhythm.
 The same applies if you have MIDI – by choosing a rhythm (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

 half-note, quarter-note, or a custom rhythm pattern) and playing in the
 pitches you can enter the music into a blank score.

 You mask out the staffs up to the one you want to follow and the ones from
 after that up to the same part in the next system and so on.
 To do this you drag down over the material you want to exclude – it turns

\begin_layout Section
Comparing Scores
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the File menu is a command that lets you compare two Denemo scores for
 differences.
 You are given a dialog to choose each Denemo score and then these are loaded
 into two tabs and Denemo then scans for differences.
 It first flags up any differences in the Score, Movement and Staff/Voice
 information and then starts going through the scores note-by-note.
 You can stop the checking at any particular note or other music object
 where there is a difference and the cursor is left on that note in each
 score.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Creating an Index
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the File menu there is a sub-menu Indexing that allows you to create
 an index for all the Denemo scores you have in all the sub-directories
 starting from some chosen directory (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

folder
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the Create Index command you choose the starting directory for the
 scores you want to index and Denemo then scans all the scores below that
 creating a new score that typesets as an index to your scores.
 For each score the composer, title, instrumentation and the music for the
 incipit of the piece is typeset, together with the Score Comment if there
 is one.
 This index can be further refined by the Sort and Filter commands in the
 same menu.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can create your own selection of scores indexed using the Filter by
 Scheme Condition
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Writing-Scheme-Scripts"

\end_inset

.
 For this you write a valid Scheme expression that is true for the files
 you want.
 You write this Scheme expression in the Scheme Script window (show this
 via the View menu).
 The expression can involve the symbols called composer, title, comment,
 filename and instruments.
 These are all strings except for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

instruments
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is a list of strings [for example the Scheme condition (= 2 (length
 instruments)) will select all scores that have two staffs].
 This filtering of an already created index is very quick as the files do
 not have to be found again, however the selection is limited to just those
 properties of the score.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With Create Conditional Index you can create more complex conditions to
 determine which scores should be included in the index, and in addition
 you can create a comment for the index entry based on the score's content.
 A convenience function DenemoIndexCommentDisplay is provided to set the
 comment you wish to include in the index entry for a given score.
 Here is an example which computes the durations of all the movements in
 the score and prints that as the comment:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
#t
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
This example ends with the symbol #t to make it clear that all the scores
 are to be included in the index.
 If the last expression was something like (= (d-GetStaffsInMovement) 2)
 then it would only include scores with two staffs in the index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Print View shows the index and looking down it you can identify a score
 by the first few bars shown - then you can click on the filename to open
 the score.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are limitations – the PDF must be created from your score with point-and-c
lick (the default) and you must not alter the score in a way that would
 invalidate the point-and-click.
 (Basically, don't edit again until the proof-reading is done, always good
 practice!) Also, enter the annotations in order from the start and don't
 edit before you have entered all the annotations, as this could invalidate
 the point-and-click.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Denemo has much better transposition facilities than the common music notation
 programs such as Sibelius, Finale and Musescore.
 If you have used those programs you are probably thinking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I need to transpose this music
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, meaning you are going to change all the notes and chords you have entered
 along with the key signatures.
 You 
\series bold
can 
\series default
do this in Denemo (see Physical Transposition
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Physical-Transposition"

\end_inset

) but usually it is far better just to say that you want score to be typeset
 in the new key.
 This takes care of everything in one go – even footnotes that refer to
 the pitches of notes in the music will transpose (unless you have entered
 them as fixed values).
 And your input music stays looking just as you entered it – essential if
 you have to look back and compare with a source for instance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The commands to transpose a score are in the Score->Typesetter menu.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Transpose on Print
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a graphical user interface – you get presented with a new tab containing
 two notes – clicking the Transpose button will transpose so that the first
 pitch will be typeset as the second one.
 The initial values a C and E♭ (up a minor third) so by typing G this would
 become up a fifth.
 The first note could be changed as well, if you know that D should become
 F♯, for example, then you can make those the two notes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other command is quicker but more technical – (Print) Transposed lets
 you type in the names of the two notes.
 The technical bit is how you specify sharp and flat and which octave.
 To specify sharp the note is followed by

, for flat 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 (these are actually the Dutch names!).
 Octaves are indicated by ' for up and , for down, so for example c c,,
 would mean transpose two octaves down.

In the case where you have changed your mind and want the actual notes you
 have entered to be altered the commands to do this are in the Notes/Rests->Tran

 Transpose Up.
 These allow you to describe the interval you want to transpose the music

 m7 for a minor seventh, d5 for diminished 5th.
 Alternatively you can use two pitches to describe the interval as in the

There are two categories of search available in Denemo.
 The first is in Navigation->Seek menu and the other is in the Edit menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Navigation->Seek is the command to find a selected rhythmic pattern (Ctrl-f,
 Ctrl-f) – that is to find a sequence of notes with the same rhythms as
 those of the selection.
 Once found the pattern can be edited, either manually or by executing a
 series of steps recorded in the Scheme window (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 There is also a command to find to find a sequence of selected notes.
 In both these cases the search can be resumed by executing the command
 with no selection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second sort of search is in the Edit menu (and also available from the
 Object Editor).
 Ctrl-e,e starts a search for objects of the type that the cursor is on,
 while Ctrl-e, Ctrl-e offers all the types of object in the movement and
 allows you to select which to search for.
 Ctrl-e,r resumes the search.
 When found the object can be manually edited, deleted or modified using
 recorded commands as described above.
 The search order is column-wise, that is everything at the same musical
 moment is searched and then the next musical moment is searched from the
 top staff downwards.
 When the end of movement is reached you can wrap to the start of the movement
 or move to the next movement or wrap round to the first movement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Rapidly Marking Passages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Frequently passages in a score need marking in some way - they need to be
 played up an octave, or they have a continuous trill sign above them etc.
 This is called Spanning
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Spanning
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and the indicators for where the passage starts or ends is frequently marked
 by a pair of Denemo Directives or other pair of objects.
 Examples are in the Directives->Markings->Spanning menu.
 Other examples are tuplets
\begin_inset Index idx

, and passages in a different clef.
 Where a lot of passages need to be marked like this there is command in

 by a particular pair of objects at a single key press.
 This command is labelled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Span Selection with Pair of Objects
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and it works by copying the pair to be inserted around selected passages
 onto the clipboard when the command is first invoked and then subsequent
 invocations place the spanning objects before/after the passage you have
 selected.
 In this way you can work your way through a score selecting passages to
 be altered and applying the alteration at the touch of a key.

For mouse shortcuts invoke the Command Center with the right click on the

 The Set Mouse Shortcut Dialog requires you to set which button and action
 you want to use and then to hold/lock the keyboard modifier while clicking
 on the big button.
 The setting you have chosen is shown, and you click ok to accept it.

Adding More Features 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to add more commands to the set that Denemo ships with.
 Some of these are shipped with Denemo, but not added automatically so as
 to keep the menu sizes manageable.
 Generally, you right-click to find more menu items to add; once added you
 can set a keyboard/mouse shortcut and keep the command in your default
 setup.
 Scheme to be executed at startup can be placed in the denemo.scm file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
An example – quicker dynamics selection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can be slow to choose dynamics (
\family typewriter
Ctrl-D
\family default
) because the list is quite long to move down (or move to the mouse).
 You can define a list of the dynamics you actually want to be readily available
 as for example: (define DenemoDynamicList '(("f" "127" "Forte") ("p" "127"
 "Piano"))) This makes forte available just by pressing Return and piano
 available by pressing down arrow Return.
 (The others via More of course).
 If you place this in (home directory)/.denemo-x.x.x/actions/denemo.scm then
 it will be defined when you start Denemo.

Recording a Denemo Macro
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "subsec:Recording-a-Denemo"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can record a frequently used sequence of actions into the Scheme window.
 These can be used in search and replace operations or they can be installed
 as a command in the menu system and given a keyboard shortcut or placed
 in a palette.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To do this choose View->Scheme Script.
 (You do not have to understand what a Scheme Script is to use this!) In
 the window that pops up check Record Scheme Script and then do the set
 of steps you wish Denemo to record.
 As you execute each command the Scheme window gets that command added to
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, suppose you wanted to place a trill on a particular note in
 a certain rhythmic pattern that occurs frequently in a piece.
 You would record the cursor moves and the Trill command needed to edit
 the pattern concerned and then use the Search and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Replace
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 facility to seek the pattern you needed selecting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Continue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Execute Scheme
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as each pattern is found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or, suppose you wanted a command to delete the next note (there are commands
 to delete the previous note and the current note, so why not?).
 You would enter some notes, put on Record Scheme Script and then move the
 cursor right two steps and delete the previous note (with Backspace if
 that is your shortcut).
 (Each time you use a command you will see the Scheme syntax for that command
 entered into the Scheme window).
 Now turn off Record Scheme Script and you can experiment with your new
 command by pressing Execute in the Scheme Script window.
 To save this new command for future use, you right click on a menu item
 (in the menu where you would like the command to appear) and choose "Save
 Script as New Menu Item", this will ask you to make up a name for your
 new command as well as a label for the menu item etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can save the command in your default sequence of commands (via Edit->Customi
ze Commands\SpecialChar ldots
->Manage Command Set->Save as Default Command Set).
 If not you will be asked if you want to save your new commands when you
 exit.
 Otherwise you can re-load via the More->My Commands menu item.

 Tweak
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is another way of adding your own favorite LilyPond tweaks, which
 is by modifying a tweak that has already been done.
 This can be done by using the text-edit dialog on an existing Denemo Directive
 (usually found under the Advanced button provided in the Object Editor
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Object-Editor"

\end_inset

).
 Here you can see the actual LilyPond text that will be inserted, and there
 is a button to create a script to generate whatever you choose to enter.
 You can also enter the name of graphic images (.png files) that are to be
 used to represent your item in the display, and say where it should be
 positioned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have created the script, it can be saved in the menu system by
 right clicking on an item in the menu where you want to place the command,
 and choosing "Save Script as New Menu Item" as above.
 An alternative to creating a command in the menu system is to create a
 palette button (see the Object Editor

).

If you are a programmer you will have guessed that you can edit the Scheme
 Script window to create any command you want.
 Even if you are not familiar with Scheme you may find that you can adapt
 other scripts to do what you want.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A good example of this is a script to insert a particular LilyPond directive
 into the score.
 This is all that many scripts do: it is easy to see the piece of LilyPond
 in the Scheme Script window, and by changing it you can create a new command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, from the More menu select the command /menus/ObjectMenu/Instruments
/Orchestral/RehearsalMark (the files are laid out in folders/directories
 in the same way as the menu system itself).
 Then choose Get Script into Scheme Window from the right click menu.
 With this command its script is appended to the Scheme Script window.
 Here you can see the part that says

which is inserting the LilyPond directive "
\backslash

\backslash

 (The extra backslashes are needed to tell Scheme that you literally mean
 a 
\backslash
 sign).
 You can change this to insert any other LilyPond that you need – always
 doubling the 
\backslash
 signs.
 Then you can save as a new menu item, a palette button, or use Save Script
 from Scheme Window to customize the command you started with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More ambitious programmers will need to know all the commands available.
 Besides the complete Denemo command set (the list is given in the Command
 Center window) there are the following additional Scheme procedures defined
 (see the files actions/denemo.scm and actions/denemo-modules/*.scm for more).
 A brief summary of any Scheme procedure can be obtained by typing its name
 into the Scheme Window in the command line interface (CLI) and pressing
 Enter.
 The help text attached to built-in commands is available in a Scheme variable
 constructed by prefixing the command name with

Commands for MIDI Import
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A MIDI file can be loaded into Denemo in order to convert it to music notation.
 This is not generally possible (because of the nature of the information
 stored in the MIDI format), but it is worth trying sometimes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(d-ImportMidi "guided=true") this call lets the user choose a MIDI file
 and creates a MIDI structure to represent its contents.

 Using d-DirectiveGet-standalone tag a directive of a particular tag can
 be found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(d-Directive-type? optional-tag) where type is one of score, scoreheader,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Standard Denemo commands that pop up dialogs will work as usual if no argument
 is passed to them from Scheme.
 In general if a string consisting of strings of the form "name=value" is
 passed these will be used and no popup will occur.
 The field "name" will be given the value "value".
 The 
\backslash
0 is a NULL character that separates the assignment strings.
 As a shorthand if there is only one value being passed you can just pass
 the value.
 The names of the fields depend on the action being called.
 So for example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
begin{verbatim}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

(d-Open "filename=myfile.denemo")

\begin_layout Subsection
Midi Filters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MIDI filters are scheme scripts, so they can be tailored to do whatever
 you wish.
 One example is a filter that enables you to enter Figured Bass figures
 by playing the notes corresponding to the figures while holding down the
 bass note.
 Another is the "AngryDelete" filter.
 With this filter on notes are entered normally with the cursor advancing
 automatically, but if you make a mistake and press the wrong note just
 hit the next one much louder and it will make the correction for you! MIDI
 filters are found under Input -> MIDI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
LilyPond Editing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From version 0.7.8 we have the ability to edit the LilyPond output within
 Denemo.
 This approach immediately makes Denemo able to do many more things (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
 multiple verses for songs) with the music still editable from within Denemo.
 The gallery of examples and the standard templates contain examples which
 you can use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These can be used without knowing the LilyPond language (provided a suitable
 template or example file exists).
 Alternatively, with a general idea of how a LilyPond file works tweaks
 from the LilyPond documentation can be inserted into the LilyPond output
 and stored with the Denemo, leaving open the possibility of further editing
 of the notes within Denemo without the need to re-apply tweaks or keep
 separate LilyPond files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Using the LilyPond Window
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under the View menu is a Show LilyPond item which pops up a window with
 the LilyPond output in it.
 The text is interspersed with buttons which enable you to hide or show
 the various sections or to create custom versions.
 The text in bold can be altered and the alterations are kept in the Denemo
 file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two windows are kept in sync, so you can move back and forth between
 editing textually and editing in Denemo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right clicking on the text gives a menu for actions on the LilyPond text.
 LilyPond text can be inserted between notes, and the final section (the
 score layout) can be turned into editable text (see Score Layout).
 There is one for moving the cursor to the LilyPond text for the current
 Denemo object.
 Moving the cursor in the text window with the arrow keys causes the Denemo
 window cursor to move in synchronism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This menu also includes a Print command that operates on the visible LilyPond
 text in the window.
 This means you can open specific custom score layouts and print from them,
 or even make a temporary edit for just one print.
 If you save the score with custom layouts then these are remembered.
 So when you reload and the custom score layout will be printed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Detail
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several custom layouts can be kept, selecting them in the Score Layout view
 enables the same Denemo file to print a variety of things from the same
 music input.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, a full score or a set of parts, or several voices on group
 of staffs or even a piano reduction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The various Voices/Staffs for the different Movements are separated by buttons.
 These are labelled by enumerating the movements and staffs in order, so
 the first voice in the first movement has the music defined as "MvmntIVoiceIMus
ic" and so on.
 Within these music blocks you can insert arbitrary LilyPond text between
 notes, (the insertion points are marked by grey blocks) and the text inserted
 will appear as a LilyPond directives in the main Denemo window.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main Denemo window also moves its cursor to correspond with where you
 are editing.
 (It should of course move the cursor immediately you click on a point in
 the music, but, as yet, it only moves the cursor when you press a key just
 before the note name – one of the arrow keys will do).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Custom layout blocks can be created by right-clicking on the Standard score
 layout and selecting create custom score layout.
 The Score Layout window allows creation of customized layouts via a GUI.
 If you print a single part from all movements, you get the standard scoreblock
 for this and can add it to your custom score block so that a single print
 command prints, e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
 both a full score and parts.
 Using the 
\backslash
book {} block you can put these into separate files (stored in the folder
 .denemo in your home folder).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The music defined by MvmntIVoiceIMusic is then used in the score blocks
 at the end of the LilyPond window, by the expression 
\backslash
MvmntIVoiceIMusic.
 This means that the same music can be output in several different ways,
 so that the same Denemo file can contain custom score blocks to output
 the music as a Piano Score with several voices or separate parts, for example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The definitions for MvmntIVoiceIMusic actually look like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
MvmntIVoiceIProlog = {
\backslash
MvmntIVoiceITimeSig 
\backslash
MvmntIVoiceIKeySig 
\backslash
MvmntIVoiceIClef} 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
MvmntIVoiceIMusic = {
\backslash
MvmntIVoiceIProlog 
\backslash
MvmntIVoiceI}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\backslash
MvmntIVoiceI is the actual block of notes you have written, while the other
 definitions hold the time signature, clef etc.
 By using these, you can print the same music with different clefs, still
 maintaining the ability to edit the notes in Denemo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the normal Denemo Print commands are still operate as they do
 if you never look at the LilyPond window.
 What happens is that if you select the Print Current Part menu item then
 this creates a tailored standard scoreblock for that part.
 However, if you use the File->Print command then it prints the first custom
 scoreblock that is open (visible) (or the standard scoreblock if you do
 not have any custom scoreblocks).

\begin_layout Standard
Denemo Objects are all the things that are placed in the measures of the
 staffs in the Denemo Display.
 These are Chords, Notes (single note chords), Rests, Clef Changes, Key
 Changes, Time Signature Changes, Voice Changes (stemming control), Tuplet
 Starts, Tuplet Ends and Denemo Directives.
 The Denemo cursor can be stepped through every Denemo Object in the bar
 and by double clicking the object can be inspected and edited in detail.

Denemo Directives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Denemo Directives give attributes to objects that are not built-in but can
 be changed by the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Denemo Directives can be attached at almost every level of a Denemo score
 and can modify the behavior of the element concerned.
 They contain fields to describe how the element's properties should be
 modified, either in the display or in the printing.
 Elements, such as clefs notes etc have their own built-in display and print
 properties; Denemo Directives allow you (or scripts you invoke) to modify
 them for many more purposes than the built-in set allows.
 This means Denemo can grow – you can add features – without getting a new
 version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example the drum clef is not built-in to Denemo.
 Instead a directive attached to the clef has a field (graphic) set to an
 image of the drum clef, and another field (postfix) set to the LilyPond
 syntax for a drum clef, while another field (override) is set to indicate
 that these values should replace the normal ones, rather than adding to
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The elements that can be modified in this way are the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
score: the LilyPond fields (prefix and postfix) are placed at the start
 of the score and just before each movement.
 The display field is shown at the top of the display.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
scoreheader: Attached to the score.
 The postfix field is put inside a 
\backslash
header{} block at the start of the score.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
movementcontrol: Attached to a movement.
 The prefix field is placed before the movements 
\backslash
score{} block, the postfix after it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
header: Attached to a movement.
 As scoreheader but for 
\backslash
header{} blocks inside the movement's score block.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
paper: Attached to the score.
 The postfix is placed inside a 
\backslash
paper{} block.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
layout: Attached to a movement.
 The postfix is placed inside a 
\backslash
layout{} block in the movement's scoreblock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
clef: Attached to a clef or clef change.
 The graphic holds the displayed icon, gx,gy its position.
 The postfix field is put into the music at the point where the clef is
 found, replacing the normal text if the override is set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
timesig: Attached to a time signature or time signature change.
 The graphic holds the displayed icon, gx,gy its position.
 The postfix field is put into the music at the point where the time signature
 is found, replacing the normal text if the override is set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
keysig: as timesig but for key signatures.
 (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
 used to supress keysignatures in drum clef).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
staff: The postfix field modifies the whole staff context, with the display
 field printed at the start of the staff
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
voice: The postfix field modifies the voice context, with the display field
 printed at the start of the staff containing the voice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
standalone: A directive not attached to an music element – it comes with
 the music and is used for things like repeat bars etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
chord: The prefix field is emitted before the LilyPond for the chord and
 the postfix after it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
note: The prefix field is emitted before the LilyPond for the note and the
 postfix after it.
 Examples are fingerings attached to notes etc.
 Again the display and graphic fields a placed in the display positioned
 relative to the note via the coordinate fields gx, gy (for the graphic)
 and tx, ty for the display text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Directives are sufficiently important to have their own commands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
d-DirectivePut-type-field where type is one of score, scoreheader, movementcontr
ol, header, paper, layout, clef, timesig, keysig, staff, voice, standalone,
 chord or note and field is one of display, tx, ty, gx, gy, graphic, prefix,
 postfix, override, midibytes.
 These commands take two arguments, a tag (string) and a value to set.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Directive Fields
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fields of the Denemo Directive can control the Denemo Display and the
 LilyPond output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fields in d-DirectiveGet/Put have the following meanings:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
postfix – A fragment of LilyPond to be output (after the LilyPond for any
 object the directive is attached to).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
prefix – A fragment of LilyPond to be output (before the LilyPond for any
 object the directive is attached to).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
display – text to be shown in the Denemo Display
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
tx,ty – where to show the text in the Denemo Display
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
graphic – For directives that are in the music this is a .png image to be
 shown in the Denemo Display (the directory bitmaps holds these).
 The graphic can be saved for a command using the right-click -> Save Graphic
 command, after selecting a portion of the print preview as the image required.
 For directives attached to the score, movement etc the string set here
 will be displayed on the button in the button box for that sort of directive
 (see Show Score Titles etc in view menu for showing this button box).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
gx,gy – where to show thegraphic in the Denemo Display
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
minpixels – how much space to leave for this item in the Denemo Display
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
override – Contains bits to determine whether the LilyPond contained in
 the Directive (postfix and/or prefix fields) should override the normal
 LilyPond output, and whether the Graphic should replace the normal Denemo
 display for the item.
 A further tranche of bits controls MIDI output for the directive, which
 can override the normal MIDI interpretation of the music and provide additional
 information not explicit in the music notation (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
 the tempo of an Adagio marking).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
midibytes – a string of numbers (in hexadecimal format) whose interpretation
 is given by the MIDI bits in the override field
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The override field contains the following bits:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_LILYPOND: override the LilyPond output normally used at
 this point, rather than adding to the normal output.
 The text used is in the prefix and postfix fields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_GRAPHIC: overrides what Denemo would normally show in the
 display with the image named in the graphic field of the directive
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MIDI bits in the override field are as follows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_VOLUME: the MIDI velocity to use
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_DURATION: affects the duration of a note.
 not yet implemented
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

 (from a directive of the same tag).
 not yet implemented
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_CHANNEL: midibytes field gives the MIDI channel to use (?
 implemented?)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_TEMPO: midibytes field gives the tempo to use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interpretation of these flags is modified by the following flags:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_ONCE: the value in midibytes is to be used just for the
 item the directive is attached to.
 not yet implemented
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_STEP: the value in midibytes is to be used from this point
 on
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_RAMP: the value in midibytes is to be used as a starting
 value, a corresponding directive (i.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

e.
 with the same tag) gives the findal value, values are then interpolated
 between these.
 not yet implemented
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_RELATIVE: value in midibytes is used relative to the current
 value (otherwise it is an absolute value; e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
 an absolute velocity etc)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_PERCENT: value in midibytes is interpreted as percentage
 value.
 not yet implemented
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These flags are combined together to get the combination required for the
 directive using the scheme procedure called logior.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Directive Edit Scripts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Score and movement directives can define a value for their graphic – a button
 then appears at the top of the score which can be used to edit the directive.
 Likewise Staff and Voice directives show as a properties icon before the
 staff to which they apply (staff directives above, voice directives below).
 Clicking on these lets you edit the directive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The command EditDirective can be used when the cursor is on a Denemo Directive
 object, or an object with a Denemo Directive attached to it.
 What happens then is determined by a script named after the "tag", or name
 of the directive.
 For example the command RehearsalMark creates a Directive with tag "RehearsalMa
rk" and EditDirective runs a script called RehearsalMark.scm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is also a low-level editing dialog which is invoked if no editing
 script exists or directly from scheme using (d-DirectiveTextEdit-* tagname).
 This allows you to edit and delete a directive directly.
 The other directive editing commands are EditScoreDirective EditMovementDirecti
ve EditStaffDirective EditVoiceDirective EditClefDirective EditKeysigDirective
 EditTimesigDirective for directives attached to the relevant objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The low level edit of directives from scheme uses the following command:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
begin{verbatim}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

(d-DirectiveTextEdit-<field> <tagname>)

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
end{verbatim}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Where <tagname> specifies the directive to be edited and <field> is one
 of score, scoreheader, movementcontrol, header, paper, layout, clef, timesig,
 keysig, staff, voice, standalone, chord or note.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
begin{verbatim}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
gives low-level access to the directive setting the print all headers command
 in the paper block of the LilyPond output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Initialization Scripts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each menu can have an initialization script, which can contain procedures
 that would be too time consuming to define every time they are needed.
 These scripts are guaranteed to be run before any menu item is activated
 within the menu.
 They can be read/written using the right click menu on any scripted menu
 item.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Edit Scripts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each directive has a tag field, so that it can be recognized by the scripts
 that manipulate it.
 In particular for each tag there can be an edit script, for editing a directive
 of that tag.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Edit scripts are kept in a directory actions/editscripts parallel with the
 directory actions/menus where the commands themselves are kept.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can read and write edit scripts by using the low level editing dialog
 on a directive with the tag you are writing for.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The low level editing dialog is the one that is presented if there is no
 edit script.
 Edit scripts can themselves give access to this dialog by including an
 option cue-Advanced which calls (d-DirectiveTextEdit-field tag) for the
 appropriate field and tag.
 For an example see the edit script for Instruments -> Orchestra -> RehearsalMar
k.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They have available functions to enable editing of directives which are
 defined in actions//denemo.scm executed at startup.
 The functions and variables for script editing are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
d-GetOption followed by a nul separated list of options, offers the options
 to the user and returns one, or #f if the user cancels.
 More useful commands RadioBoxMenu and RadioBoxMenuList are built on this
 for a nicer interface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Extra-Offset tag type context.
 Takes three string options: tag is the name of the directive to be edited,
 which must be the name of a LilyPond object, type is the type of directive
 (note, chord, standalone, staff, voice or score), context is the LilyPond
 context of the object.
 Only tag is required.
 Shifts the object in the LilyPond output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SetPadding tag type context.
 As Extra-Offset, it sets the space left around the item in the LilyPond
 engraving process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SetRelativeFontSize tag type context.
 As Extra-Offset, it shifts the font size of the following text in the LilyPond
 engraving process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
CreateButton tag label this is just a convenience function to put a button
 with the passed in label onto a button box at the top of the screen.
 Scripts can attach actions to such tagged buttons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
d-SetDirectiveTagActionScript tag scheme-actions.
 This command sets scheme-actions as the actions to be performed when the
 button of the given tag is clicked.
 The default action is to run any editscript associated with tag, and if
 none to run the d-DirectiveTextEdit-score on the directive that displays
 the button.

, where more up-to-date information will be found.
 This is the preferred way of obtaining Denemo, as the various offerings
 from elsewhere are often either broken or out-of-date.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Upgrading Denemo
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you already have a version of Denemo then installing a new version brings
 with it the question of retaining your preferences, shortcuts etc.
 These are stored in a directory (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

folder
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in windows) in your home directory that is named after the Denemo version
 number.
 So for version number 2.0.0 the directory is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.denemo-2.0.0
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They are copied for you from the old directory to the new one if you ask
 for this on startup.
 If you forget to do this you can delete the new directory .denemo-2.0.2 (say)
 and when you start Denemo it will again ask if you want to keep your preference
s from the earlier version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Obtaining the Source
